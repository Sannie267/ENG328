[[Start]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Start" tags="" position="700,225" size="100,100">You move past the cluttered shelves and made your way to the store’s front door. Nothing in particualr was tickling your interest that day. Maybe when a next hoard of nick-knacks arrived you’d have better luck.
[[Keep walking]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Keep walking" tags="" position="700,350" size="100,100">”Ouch!” Pain throbbed agaisnt your foot as you stepped into the side of an old box. It sat with its corner poking out from beneath a shelf—a perfect trap for tripping someone up. You cursed at the stupid thing and moved past it. But something strange about the box called your attention.
[[Look at the box]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Look at the box" tags="" position="700,475" size="100,100">The box was old and dust-covered thing, held together by limp pieces of failing tape. The words “JUNK GAMES” had been scribbled on it’s face with black ink. You knelt down and examined the old thing. It had character, and strangely, you wanted to know what was inside.
[[Pick up the box]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Pick up the box" tags="" position="700,600" size="100,100">You carried the box to thrit shop’s front counter and plopped it down before the half-sleeping cashier. “Can I open this box up?” You asked.
[[Wait for reply]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Wait for reply" tags="" position="700,725" size="100,100">”Oh,” the cashier mused as she peered down at the box. “That old thing has been with us since we opened! I haven’t seen it in a while, and honestly, I was hoping that trash was stolen. Gives me less to clean.” She poked at the box’s deflating sides and stared up at You.
You waited for a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but the woman shrugged and grumbled on. “I’ll cut you a deal. Take the whole box for ten bucks, get it outta here now and you can open it at home, but not in my store.”
[[Give the cashier the money. Leave the store with the box.]]
or 
[[Leave the box. Leave the store epmty-handed.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Give the cashier the money. Leave the store with the box." tags="" position="700,850" size="100,100">You shut the door to your car. You slide the key into the ignition and listen as it rumbles to life. The box is buckled into the passenger seat and sits contently.
[[Drive away]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Leave the box. Leave the store epmty-handed." tags="" position="825,850" size="100,100">You shut the door to your car and slid the key into the ignition. You listened as the car rumbled to life. For a moment, you think about the wild possibilites of what that box might hold. Should you have left the store so quickly?
[[You return to the store and buy the old box.]]
or
[[You drive away, doing your best to forget about the old box. Maybe that $10 would be better spent for some coffee and donuts!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Drive away" tags="" position="700,975" size="100,100">The drive home was calm. When you pulled into the driveway, you unbuckled the box and promptly brought it inside your home. The old thing nearly crumbled as it was placed on the kitchen counter. You want to know the content of the box. 
[[Open the box]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Open the box" tags="" position="700,1100" size="100,100">Curiousity consumes you, and you open the box with a dull kitchen knife. Truthfully, you could have opened the old thing with nothing but your hands. It was decrepit and fragile. You flipped open the cardboard to reveal a treasure trove of wires and old plastic.
[[Keep looking inside the box]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Keep looking inside the box" tags="" position="700,1225" size="100,100">Inside the box you find a strange red headset, a collection of battered game cases and a tangle of cords. Examining the contents closer, you inspect the box of junk with a close eye and notices that something on the headset is blinking. 
[[Concerned there may be a leakage, you decide to throw the box away]]
or motivated by curiosity... 
[[You decide to put on the headset]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Concerned there may be a leakage, you decide to throw the box away" tags="" position="700,1350" size="100,100">Carrying the bin of junk out the back door of your kitchen, you swing open the lid of the trash can that sits behind your house and plop the contents within. “What a waste,” you mumble to yourself sourly.
[[Get back inside your house]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="You decide to put on the headset" tags="" position="825,1350" size="100,100">The typically-glass eye covers that usually comes with goggles has been replaced by a hard plastic that you can’t see out of. Instead, a dimly glowing screen pulses before your eyes, inviting you to start the game. 
[[“PRESS TO BEGIN”]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Get back inside your house" tags="" position="700,1475" size="100,100">The moment you walk back into your kitchen, the box is back on the counter. “What the…”. You see the box again. 
[[You try to throw it out again, returning it to the bin behind your house.]]
or you give the box a second inspection. How strange! The headset is still glowing. 
[[You put it back on out of curiousity.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="You try to throw it out again, returning it to the bin behind your house." tags="" position="700,1600" size="100,100">After you throw it out again you walk back inside. 
[[Get back inside your house]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="You put it back on out of curiousity." tags="" position="825,1625" size="100,100">After looking at it for a few second you made your final choice...
[[You decide to put on the headset]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="“PRESS TO BEGIN”" tags="" position="825,1475" size="100,100">There is not button to press. No controllers to be used. But somehow, the goggles seem to acknowledge your curiosity. The title screen flashes once, and pixles begin to move before your eyes. From beyond the small screen you hear crashes around you. It sounds as if thunder has struck your kitchen countertop!
[[Continue]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Continue" tags="" position="950,1600" size="100,100">Red light dances in the corner of your eye, pulsing in the shadows of the goggles. You try to throw the junk off from your face, but as you reach for the plastic, somthing snatches your hand away.
[[Keep going]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Keep going" tags="" position="950,1725" size="100,100">You feel your eyes being pulled forward, your face leans deeper into the device that obscures your vision. The thunderous snaps droan out the sounds of your panic, and you feel your head being snatched into the  pixle-coverd screen. Just as quickly as it all started, everything seems to go quiet.
[[Keep calm]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Keep calm" tags="" position="950,1850" size="100,100">The beginnings of a headache bloom at the bridge of your nose. Everything around you is dark. You scrub at your eyes for a moment hoping that your vision will return when a gentle hand taps you on the shoulder. A static, distorted voice asks, “Are you okay?”
Annoyed by the series of paranormal incidents you...
[[Shook the hand off and decides express your anger with your fist.]]
or being startled by the sudden presence
[[You turn around and start shouting at the figure. “Who the hell are you!

You looked up with surprise and see a familiar figure standing before you.
[[Ask a question]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="You turn around and start shouting at the figure. “Who the hell are you! How’d you get into my house?”" tags="" position="1075,1975" size="100,100">“Your home?” The voice say skeptically. “This isn’t anyone’s home.” The hand returns to your should, and out of instinct, you peer up at the familiar face that looms above you.
”Are you Ma…” you hesitate, unsure as to what to say. The character before you takes your surprise and silence as an oppritunity to speak on your behalf: “Yes! it’s a me! Mario.” Your eyes scan the pixilated body before you, unsure how to react to the presence of a decades-old icon—a digital icon at that. It truly was Mario, looming over your crouched body.
[[Keep the story going]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Ask a question" tags="" position="950,2100" size="100,100">”Are you Ma…” you hesitate, unsure as to what to say. The character before you takes your shock as an oppritunity to speak on your behalf: “Yes…” he says as he slowly drops your fist from his grasp. “Mario,” you mumble in disbelief. Your eyes scan the pixilated body before you, unsure how to react to the presence of a decades-old icon—a digital icon at that. It truly was Mario standing before you.
[[Press to continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Press to continue" tags="" position="950,2225" size="100,100">”Who are you?” Mario asks. He looks as though he’s being stern, but his distroted voice makes his tone hard to discern. “How did you get here, and why are you in the midst of my tennis match?”
[[You choose not to answer, keeping your gaze steady as you raise your guard.]]
or
[[Accepting that Mario is the only being you can speak to, you reluctantly explain how you ended up here, hoping he can help you escape.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="You choose not to answer, keeping your gaze steady as you raise your guard." tags="" position="950,2350" size="100,100">Ignoring the presence of Mario, you take a few steps back, observing the pixelated place around you. The eerie silence and unsettling colors make the place feel like a prison. [[Affected by the disturbing atmosphere, you anxiously look for signs of escape.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Accepting that Mario is the only being you can speak to, you reluctantly explain how you ended up here, hoping he can help you escape." tags="" position="1075,2350" size="100,100">Mario—who is nothing more than a collection of glowing red pixels, seems to look confused. Reluctantly, he admits that he doesn’t know how to help you. “This court is all I know,” he says. “I don’t know what to do for you.”
[[Let Mario keep talking.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Affected by the disturbing atmosphere, you anxiously look for signs of escape." tags="" position="950,2475" size="100,100">In the furthest corner of the dark world you’ve been pulled into, a buzzing pixel catches your eye, jumping back and forth like a glitch in the distance. You run to it, creating distance between yourself and Mario. 
[[You lean down to inspect the buzzing pixel.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="You lean down to inspect the buzzing pixel." tags="" position="950,2600" size="100,100">You look to Mario who lingers where you last left him. He is far away, and doesn’t pay much mind to you any longer. You reach out a hand, and slowly, you move to touch the glitching pixel.
[[Touch the pixel]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Touch the pixel" tags="" position="950,2725" size="100,100">As you make contact with the pixel, your hand is pulled into its vibrating red light. A thunderous bang erupts from behind you, and in a flash, you are sucked into the pixel, breaking into a new world and leaving Mario behind.
[[Press to keep going]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Press to keep going" tags="" position="950,2850" size="100,100">As you fall through what feels like a dark, desolate sky, you can’t help but scream. The pixel must have brought you into a new game! How bizarre! you fall for what feels like ages and seconds all at once, and finally, you hit something soft and round with a hard THUD!
You bounce off the thing that cushioned your fall, and take a moment to rub your head. “Ouch,” you grumble to yourself. As you steady yourself and stand from the ground, someone behind you calls your attention. “Get back here!”
[[Turn around]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Turn around" tags="" position="950,2975" size="100,100">Turning quickly, you lock eyes with what appears to be none other than Wario, a giant, angry figure generated in nothing but the same red pixels that made up Mario. He charges at you swiftly, and as he begins to pick up his speed even more, you notice that he must’ve been the soft cushion to break your fall! No wonder he was angry!
[[Run]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Run" tags="" position="950,3100" size="100,100">You run as fast as your legs can carry you, running past the array of red pixels that block your way and as far from Wario as possible! But he’s hot on your trail and seems far angrier than Mario ever was!
You jump past rocks and strange obstacles that are scattered about, generated in a red glow that fills this dark void. But all your running seems to have been for nothing! A bright red line glows mere feet away from you, but Wario is quicker than your legs could have ever been, and he snatches you up with his open, meaty palm. “Got you now!” He shouts.
[[Continue with the story]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Continue with the story" tags="" position="950,3225" size="100,100">You let out a scream, and thrash in hopes that he will let you go, but the moment you close your eyes in fear, everything seems to go quiet. Your stomach drops suddenly, and the feeling of falling envelopes you entirely.
You feel yourself falling through the sky again, and peel open your eyes to see the dark, desolate world that surrounds you. Wario’s grasp must have brought you back to the beginning of his game! How bizarre! you fall for what feels like ages and seconds all at once, and finally, you hit something soft and round with a hard THUD!

End of the loop. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Let Mario keep talking." tags="" position="1075,2475" size="100,100">The mention of the court sparks a sudden thought! Beating Mario in his own game might be your best chance at getting home! You propose this idea to Mario, and wait to hear his response.
[[Press here to continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Keep the story going" tags="" position="1075,2100" size="100,100">Gently, Mario lends you a hand and helps you to your feet. “How is this all… happening?” Mario seems to be just as confused as you are, as he explains, “A moment ago I was alone, and now you’re here!”

A small bell chimes as you enter and the same cashier from earlier lifts her eyes to meet yours as she inquires, “back to reconsider my offer?”
You nod bashfully, and admit, “I couldn’t get the stupid thing off my mind!” The cashier already has the box waiting for you on the counter.
[[Pay for the box]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="You keep driving. Nothing can stop you from buying that coffee and those donuts your promised yourself only moments ago." tags="" position="1075,1100" size="100,100">It takes you no time at all to pull into the parking lot of a bougie roadside cafè. You step out of your car and head into the small building for a snack and drink.  You’ve forgotten about the old box already.
ENDING 01: For the Treats!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Pay for the box" tags="" position="950,1225" size="100,100">The cashier smiles as you hand her the $10 bill. She pats the old box once before allowing you to carry it away and out to your car. You can’t help but feel that you’re taking a piece of the store’s character—something that has been apart of it for ages.
[[Drive away]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Talk to Mario" tags="" position="1200,2350" size="100,100">You tell him that you want to break free from this chaos and go home.

It’s clear that he isn’t sure how your idea will play out, but he seems to agree to help you. He watches you carefully as you wander around the red-glowing tennis court.
[[Explore the court]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="Press here to continue" tags="" position="1200,2600" size="100,100">An eerie hum echoes througout your dark surroundings. Something seems to be acknowledging your presence. The deep vibrating sound makes your bones tremble and your knees feel weak. What is this sound, you wonder. What could this be?
“It’s the game,” Mario says, reading the perplexed look on your face. “The game must have heard our plan, and is pleased with the challenge I’ve set for your escape.” You look around, scanning the setting to see nothing more than the bright red outline of a tennis court and mario himself. Everything else is dark.
[[Ask Mario what is happening]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Ask Mario what is happening" tags="" position="1200,2725" size="100,100">”How are you sure that the game is making a good noise?” You ask Mario. Worry laces you voice and Mario seems to pick up on it quickly. “No need to be scared! If the game didn’t like our proposal, we wouldn’t be able to do this!” Snapping his gloved fingers, Mario summons two tennis rackets that glow with bright red light. He tosses one to you from where he stands, and the object seems to gravitate toward your open palm. You catch the racket with ease.
You look around and find yourself on the opposite end of the tennis court to Mario. You don’t know when this happened or how, as the two of your were side by side seconds ago.
[[Ready to go home, you brace the racket in your hands and nod to Mario.]]

Beyond the court, red glowing bleachers rise from the black ground, and an audience appears from thin air. Cheers filll the now monsterous tennis stadium, and the deep, gutteral hum from earlier returns. The game is watching you.
The game begins, Mario serves first, but as the ball crosses the net, it glitches out and re appears past you, the score is 15 Mario - 0 Player
[[Keep the game going]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="Unsure as to what to do, you look to Mario." tags="" position="1325,2850" size="100,100">Eventually, Mario tells you, “Don’t worry, kid! Get in your ready stance and the game will begin! We’ve got nothing to lose here!

Mario starts his serve, but gets stuck halfway through the process, you stand there for what feels like an eternity, while the distorted laugh gets louder and louder
As the laughing crescendos into a roar of distortion, the ball rips past you without you being able to react.
[[Not giving up]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="Something clicks, and you take a deep breath and relax" tags="" position="1325,3100" size="100,100">The game seemingly responds to your relaxation, the hum softens to be much closer to the gentle hum of electicity.
Mario serves, and you cleanly return it, the ball stays inbounds and Mario is unable to return it. Mario 30 - Player 15.
Your serve, you take a deep breath, and perfectly serve the ball out of Mario&#39;s reach. Mario 30 - Player 30.
Even closer to freedom now, you remind yourself to keep calm. The hum has become almost inaudible at this point.
[[Keep playing with calm]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="Not giving up" tags="" position="1200,3225" size="100,100">Mario 40 - Player 0. this is your final chance to win, but before you can even react the game has ended, and the words game over flash in front of you as if to mock you.
You stare angrily at the red and black pixelated scene in front of you, knowing that you are doomed to try and win a fixed game for your freedom.
ENDING 02: The Loop.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="Keep playing with calm" tags="" position="1325,3225" size="100,100">Next serve, you manage a pretty impressive rally with Mario before you manage to secure the point with a perfect drop shot. Mario 30 - Player 40.
Match point, you can barely contain your excitement at the chance of getting to go home. In the static hum you swear you can hear a voice saying &quot;you can do it&quot;.
Mario serves the ball straight towards you, and you return it perfectly. Its almost as if time slows as you watch the ball bounce the second time, securing your winning point, and your freedom.
[[Finish the game]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="Finish the game" tags="" position="1325,3350" size="100,100">You feel a rush of wind as the hum grows louder and your vision is completely overtaken with red. before you know it you are back in your kitchen, sitting in front of the headset with a massive headache and neck pain. On the screen is a small graphic of a trophy and the words &quot;You Win!&quot; You can&#39;t help but feel like something has changed within the headset for the better. You smile as you put it back on the box and place it in a spot of pride on your shelf.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="You keep stalling." tags="" position="1450,3250" size="100,100">Mario looks at you expectantly, you know that eventually you will have to start the game to earn your freedom.
[[You nod towards Mario, ready to start the game]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Explore the court" tags="" position="1325,2600" size="100,100">A buzzing pixel catches your eye, jumping back and forth like a glitch in the distance. You wave to Mario to follow your lead as you run closer to the distorted thing. Taking a knee, you lean down to inspect the buzzing pixel.
[[You grow anxious looking at the thing. You decide that perhaps this isn’t the right way to do things. You ask Mario if there is any other way to break free from this pixilated prisonGive the cashier the money. Leave the store with the box.]] 
[[You look to Mario who seems to be just as curious as you are. You reach out a hand, and slowly, you move to touch the glitching pixel. As you get closer, Mario places a hand on your shoulder. “Wait,” he begins, but it’s too late!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="You grow anxious looking at the thing.

Leave the store with the box." tags="" position="1325,2725" size="100,100">Mario suggests that beating the game might be the best option, and you quickly agree. Winning game of tennis against Mario sounds like a much more solid plan than trying to break out with force.
[[Press here to continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="You look to Mario who seems to be just as curious as you are. You reach out a hand, and slowly, you move to touch the glitching pixel. As you get closer, Mario places a hand on your shoulder. “Wait,” he begins, but it’s too late!" tags="" position="1450,2725" size="100,100">As you make contact with the pixel, your hand is pulled into its vibrating red light. Mario’s voice is cut short as a thunderous bang erupts from behind you, and in a flash, both you and Mario are sucked into the pixel, breaking into a new world.
As the two of you fall through what feels like a dark, desolate sky, you can’t help but scream. The pixel must have brought you into a new game! How bizarre! you fall for what feels like ages and seconds all at once, and finally, you and Mario hit something soft and round with a hard THUD!
[[Carry on]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="Carry on" tags="" position="1650,2900" size="100,100">You bounce off the thing that cushioned your fall, and take a moment to rub your head. “Ouch,” you grumble to yourself. Mario offers you a hand and helps you to stand from the ground. But just as the two of you dust yourselves off, someone behind you calls your attention. “Get back here!”
Turning quickly, you both lock eyes with what appears to be none other than Wario, a giant, angry figure generated in nothing but the same red pixels that make up Mario. He charges at you swiftly, and as he begins to pick up his speed even more, you notice that he must’ve been the soft cushion to break your fall! No wonder he was angry!
[[Run as fast as you can!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="Run as fast as you can!" tags="" position="1775,3025" size="100,100">You and Mario run as fast as your legs can carry you, sprinting past the array of red pixels that block your way and as far from Wario as possible! But he’s hot on your trail and seems far angrier than any rational person should be!
You jump past rocks and strange obstacles that are scattered about, generated in a red glow that fills this dark void. But all your running seems to have been for nothing! A bright red line glows mere feet away from you, but Wario is quicker than your legs could have ever been, and he swings his arm out to snatch you up with his open, meaty palm. “Got you now!” He shouts just as his fingers are about to catch your arm.
[[Keep pushing throguh!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="65" name="Keep pushing throguh!" tags="" position="1775,3150" size="100,100">You close your eyes and push your legs to move faster and faster. Wario is inches away from snatching you away, but the glowing red line is even closer! A part of you worries that this line is just another glitch and not the finish line at all, but you try your best to cross it anyways.
Just as Wario’s fingers grazie the back of your arm, you hear Mario shout to you from close behind. In your fear and shock, you completely forgot he was with you, but as he yells to you, his voice brings you a comfort you never knew you needed. “I’ll take it from here!” He says.
[[Escape this world]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="66" name="Escape this world" tags="" position="1775,3275" size="100,100">Before you get the chance to look back at your new companion, you hear a loud thud and Wario’s shouts echoing throughout this void that he calls his game. Mario surely gave him a beating, but why? Why save you and not himself? Your feet cross the red line, and just as you stop to look behind you—to glance at Mario just for a moment— your body begins to vibrate. A red light shines from your pixilated skin, and with a single thunderous bang, you find yourself warped into another world.
Your body hits the ground with a thud as you fall back onto the tiles of your kitchen floor, and along with you comes the crash of the goggles, fallen from your face and now on the tiles at your side. A large crack breaks the red plastic into two pieces, but the dimly flashing light from the goggle’s glass screen still pulses.
[[Scared, you push off the goggles]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Scared, you push off the goggles" tags="" position="1775,3400" size="100,100">From the dim glow of the screen, a soft, red reflection of light shines on the white tiled floor. You move to push the goggles further away from you, but haunt when you see the red, pixel glow of Mario’s reflection urging you to “Press A to Play”.
Congratulations, you broke free!
